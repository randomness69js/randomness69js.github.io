<h1> Addressing the Data breach (06/13/2025) </h1>
<p>
Hello everybody! This is the CEO of SMG200 World™ and SMG200 Software Development™. As you might of known, a data breach has occurred in both SMG200 World™ and SMG200 Software Development™. <br>
We would like to address the extreme danger to all of our customers as a result of the data breach. The information contained in this breach (If misused) may cause extreme harm and possibly death to you. <br>
We will NOT disclose any of the information leaked as this may cause worldwide panic. But we have steps to make your life as good as possible before your subsequent expunction.<br>
First step is to NOT tell anyone about this breach and how it could possibly hurt people. Keep your mouth closed. <br>
Second step is to spend all the remaining time with your family. Make a will. Do what you wanted the most. Spend time with your friends. Live life. Dont break the news to your family. <br>
Third step. If you feel it is time, please go to the nearest SMGStore and talk to an employee about the current situation. They will help guide you through. We know this may be very heartbreaking news but we cannot do anything. <br>
All evidence of this document will be erased soon to prevent a commotion. - SMG200. <br>

<h1> PSA: Phone Usage (05/19/2025)</h1>
<p>
If you have any questions please call ██-██-███ using the telephone provided to you near the computer. <br>
If you cannot find the telephone then please go to the computer and open up the digital phone program. If the program isnt there then please update your software. If there is no new updates then I recommend you wait. <br>
We employees at SMG200 World are coming up with new and unique innovations for all your working needs. From inventing software to hardware, our company is your one stop shop to maximum productivity and work! <br>
To use the digital telephone, you will need these 6 things. A land line cable. An ethernet cable. A modem. A computer, Our operating system and our SMGLAN Male-Male to Female 4 inch adapter. Insert the SMGLAN Adapter into the computer. <br>Then insert the ethernet cable and phone cable into the SMGLAN device. Turn on your computer and type in "PHONE" as the password. We currently dont have a program built for this so it is bundled in to our operating system. <br>
You should see a virtual keypad. Use the mouse to use the buttons and call like a phone. A microphone and speaker is required to listen and speak into the virtual phone, international phone calls still charge money so be careful. <br>
In the event of a corruption, unplug everything and shut off the computer immediately. As a safety precaution, please dispose of the computer at once to prevent harm to other people. <br>
Call our phone number and explain what happened and we will send you a new computer right away. <br>
Failure to do so will result in possible harm/death and may also result in legal action from the company due to the risk of unintended falmontating of our services. <br>
I repeat, do NOT use the computer when you sense something is wrong. As something malicious may be brewing behind the scenes. <br>
