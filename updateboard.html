<hr id="line">
<center><p> Sorry for breaking the immersion or for the inconvenience, but this is an extremely important notice that you should all know.</p></center>
<center><p> SMG200 World and all of my other projects may have to end. Why you might ask? Because I most likely have photosensitive epilepsy.</p></center>
<center><p> That means I had a seizure from flashing lights. I know this because somebody else was in the room with me and saw everything. </p></center>
<center><p> I wont go into too much detail but all you need to know is that I was working on a part with strobe effects and then everything went black. </p></center>
<center> <p> This site and countless other projects I am working on may have to end due to the risk I have to take from working on them. </p> </center>
<center> <p> I am not asking for anything from you except for your understanding and support. </p> </center>
<center> <p> Im currently looking for a solution to this mess, I will update you if anything happens. </p> </center>
